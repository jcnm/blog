Software architect and Team Lead passionate about technical innovation, I've been navigating the software development universe for over a decade, from embedded systems to complex architectures.

My journey has taken me from research laboratories to demanding industrial environments, where I've developed sharp expertise in designing architectures that comply with the strictest standards—particularly in the defense, banking, and energy sectors.

## My Expertise

As a specialist in complex systems, I excel in the technical leadership of ambitious projects. My approach combines methodological rigor and creativity, whether:
- Designing robust software architectures
- Leading technical teams toward excellence
- Developing critical embedded systems
- Optimizing DevOps processes and continuous integration

## My Background

As an expert of formal languages and programming, I've built my professional experience within renowned organizations like TotalEnergies, Nexter, Thales, and several major financial institutions, while operating through my consulting structure, Sylorion.

Alongside my professional responsibilities, I've also explored entrepreneurship through several innovative projects, particularly in emergency communication and mobile entertainment.

## My Philosophy

I firmly believe that technical excellence is not enough—it must be accompanied by clear vision and methodical execution. Every line of code, every architectural decision is guided by the constant pursuit of quality, security, and efficiency.

A natural knowledge sharer, this blog reflects my passion for technology and my commitment to contributing to the evolution of our field.
